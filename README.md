                                      FISHERS IRIS DATASET

Introduction and Background

This project will investigate and analyse the well-known Fishers Iris Data Set. This is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his paper 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems'. The data was collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify the morphologic variation of iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from three species of iris (setosa, virginica and versicolor). The length and width of the sepals and petals for each sample were recorded. This project will import and analyse the data set using python, summarize the variables, and produce graphs and plots to add visual representation of results.

Literature Review

After studying many different articles, books and videos on Fishers data set analyses which presented numerous different approaches to analysing the data set, I concluded that a simplified exploratory data analysis would work best. Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analysing data by using simple concepts from statistics and probability and presenting the results in easy-to-understand pictorial format (Nabria, 2019). The data would be analysed using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pyplot and Seaborn libraries. Histograms and scatterplots would also be produced to help visualise data and aid comparative analysis. 

Code

The code starts by importing all essential libraries which would be used throughout the project. Numpy imported as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, sys imported, pandas imported and from pandas both read_csv and scatter_matrix are both imported. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is a general-purpose array-processing package. Matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib. pyplot is mainly intended for interactive plots and simple cases of programmatic plot generation (Hunter et al, 2020). Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language (McKinney, 2020). The dataset was imported as a .csv file, which are a common file format for transferring and storing data. The basic process of loading/importing data from a csv file into a pandas data frame is with the use of the "read_csv" function in pandas (Lynn,2020), which can be seen in the first few lines of code.
