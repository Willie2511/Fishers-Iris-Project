                                      FISHERS IRIS DATASET

Introduction and Background

This project will investigate and analyse the well-known Fishers Iris Data Set. This is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his paper 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems'. The data was collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify the morphologic variation of iris flowers of three related species.
